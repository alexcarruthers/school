The makefile included creates the mythread test program. It is identical to the one provided except that the include is slightly different. The header file is different and matches my implementation.

Everything is implemented, however, for some odd reason, 9 times out of 10 it segfaults. It's an issue with the runqueue. On occasion when there is only 1 item on the queue, it adds the item twice (i.e. the runqueue would read (2,2)). However, it works for the vast majority of the time.

Here's the output from the program:
