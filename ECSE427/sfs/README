README
Because it was not apparent in the description of this assignment, I 
made the writes append to the end of the file (which means there is a 
seperate write and read pointer. However, for whatever reason, it does
not read and write from/to the same location. If I write to a new file
and then read what I wrote, it's not the same thing that comes out.
However, using the test program, the characters are sequential, meaning
the read and write works mostly. There's just something funny with the
pointers.
